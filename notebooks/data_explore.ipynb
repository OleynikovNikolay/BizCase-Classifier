These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the \"Review Team\" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the \"Resource Group\" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department.

      "> We are in the process of making preparations for the upcoming \"Tiger Team\"\n",
      "> program. Last year we held focus groups to evaluate the quality of our\n",
      "> program. One suggestion of these groups was better facilitation of the\n",

      "> request your assistance.\n",

      "> We are asking for a verbal commitment to host a Tiger project no later\n",
      "> than mid-July. No project scope needs be identified at that time, just a\n",
      "> commitment to work with the program. We have experienced high sponsor\n",
      "> demand and our resources are constrained. We don't want to reject projects\n",
      "> because we lack the necessary resources. And, we want to identify our\n",
      "> project hosts to students as early in the school year as possible. We feel\n",
      "> this will allow students to better integrate the FAP experience into their\n",
      "> recruiting efforts. It will also allow us to better match faculty\n",
      "> expertise (especially institutional) with hosts.\n",
      "> As an incentive to help us improve the FAP experience, we ask our\n",
      "> returning hosts for the same contribution as last year - $10,000. This\n",
      "> amount does not cover our variable costs, though we believe we offer hosts\n",
      "> great value in terms of product output and recruitment opportunities.\n",
      "> However, after July we will need to increase our requests for\n",
      "> contributions to help cover these costs. While we realize that it is often\n",
      "> difficult to forecast changes to operational, organizational and budgetary\n",
      "> requirements, we ask that you take this factor into consideration. Please\n",
      "> notify us of your decision to participate by email at\n",
      "> <mailto:fap@management.wharton.upenn.edu>.\n",
      "> I will forward you more detailed information and a calendar for the\n",
      "> academic year with critical dates and deadlines for hosts. As you will\n",
      "> see, we have \"moved-up\" our deadlines relative to last year to help us\n",
      "> better facilitate the host-student matching process. Our staff also asked\n",
      "> for extra time to allow faculty to have more input into the project's\n",
      "> scope earlier in the process. Our focus groups suggested both students and\n",
      "> hosts would benefit from this. Should you have any questions or concerns\n",

      "under suspension of the rules.\n",
      "\n",

      "time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line, with a \n",

      "b) to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed \n",
      "its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual \n",
      "\"comparable\" assessments (the first such assessment, which compared ROW fees \n",
      "in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands, \n",
      "increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold);\n",
      "c) to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY \n",
      "2001; and\n",
      "d) to create an open rule making process that involves all interested \n",
      "stakeholders, including Enron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the \n",
      "Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from \n",
      "points a and b above, and have agreed to points c and d.   The language we \n",

      "The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is \n",

      "I have had surgery in the interior of my mouth, specifically the lower right side of my tongue. My dentist had suspected cancer and sent me to an oral surgeon who biopsied the area.  This biopsy confirmed the dentist's opinion and off I went to MD Anderson for examination. MDA was more optimistic of diagnosis but said the area needed to be excised in any event which occured at MDA last Wednesday (the 11th). I have been at home recovering since. It has been difficult to speak although it is now much better. I will return to MDA in a month for a follow-up exam. Hopefully the excision was complete and no additional follow- up treatments will be necessary.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis that\n",
      "seriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens and\n",
      "businesses throughout the state. At the heart of the crisis is the\n",
      "extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary\n",

      "immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the\n",
      "damage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels. I am happy to\n",
      "report that those measures have been adopted, although not without\n",
      "considerable resistance from self-interested parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enact\n",
      "further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the\n",

      "You have to love the availability of beautiful lasses for viewing. Things are interesting. Enron is moving right along and we will find out about who I am working for on Friday (our auction should be completed then). Not too much else is new. My place continues to get better (as I slowly furnish it), but Portland continues to be the little sister to Seattle. A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is. Morgan told me you may no longer be with Steph? Is this true? (And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not). If that is the case, well, we can see what we can do about it. As always, I have no plans the next couple weekends, so give me a shout (still have my cell phone at 503-887-3449) if you want to take a trip on down. Your always welcome to crash on my couch...(sorry its all I have, I got rid of the futon). Hope youre doing well.\n",

      "BURBANK -- Jay Leno pulled the plug on his late-night chat show Thursday, doing his part for the state's energy crisis, but viewers weren't left in the dark. \n",
      "Flashlights, mining helmets and multicolor glow sticks helped to illuminate the set for the show dubbed a one-time-only \"The Tonight Show Unplugged,\" which Leno said saved enough electricity to light a house for a month. \n",
      " [IMAGE] \t\n",
      " The \"unplugged\" edition of \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" pokes fun at the California power crisis(Reed Saxon / A.P.) \t\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Call it NBC's \"Can't See TV.\" \n",
      "\"This is not some cheap rating ploy. ... If this works, they're gonna make us do this every night,\" Leno joked as part of his opening monologue. \n",
      "The nationally broadcast show, featuring a comic interlude with California Gov. Gray Davis, utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras, Leno said before the show began. \n",
      "Actually, in Burbank, where the taping took place at NBC Studios, the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas. The city made $5 million in profit in May after racking up $60 million in excess power sales. \n",
      "But Leno said not using studio lights, TV monitors, amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month. \n",
      "Members of the house band wore miner's helmets, with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument. \n",
      "The stage was lit by candles, torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno. Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set. \n",
      "\"This is real goofy,\" Leno said before taping got under way. \"We'll see what happens.\" Guests included Arsenio Hall, Gilbert Gottfried, a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor. \n",
      "Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma, Davis had a brief exchange with Leno, drawing laughs with the line, \"This is the first time Gray Davis and (the word) electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence.\" \n",
      "Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model. \n",
      "While there was little energy in play, there was no shortage of laughs. \n",
      "Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because, \"I've been operating in the dark for years.\" \n",
      "Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program. \n",
      "\"It was cool,\" said Lillie Harrell, 17, a tourist from Hammond, La. \"The crowd got really involved. I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights.\" \n",
      "Added Jose Tano, 21, a Burbank resident and student at the University of California, Los Angeles, \"It was a good idea and a great way to make a point.\" \n",
      "The local power company might not have made out very well, but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed. Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio. \n",

      "did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning), she said that she \n",
      "did not intend the legal meaning of those terms;  rather, she, on  a \n",
      "\"personal\" level,  felt that the company should have treated her better.  She \n",
      "mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she \n",
      "had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron, \n",
      "that she viewed the job in Sally Beck's organization as unsatisfactory \n",
      "(because Sally should be treated as a peer, not a superior), and that she \n",
      "felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the \n",
      "company.\n",
      "I described several options for her:\n",
      "Take the job she was offered in Sally Beck's organization;\n",
      "Take the job in Rick Buy's organization (I said I would have to talk to Rick \n",

      "Take severence under the standard package;\n",
      "Take severence as a \"business reorg\" but consult with Enron for a period.\n",

      "particularly happy about any of the  alternatives), but at the end of the \n",
      "discussion expressed interest in the second option.\n",
      "A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wanda's complaints \n",

      "she did not get, or jobs she felt were taken from her, reduced scope of \n",
      "control, and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate \n",
      "with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about \n",
      "job assignments.  I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story \n",
      "and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some \n",
      "insensitivity.  I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good \n",

She is responsible for the financial modeling of all the greenfield project development opportunities being pursued by Origination. She has learned to articulate the banks' concerns with the projects and equipment to be financed within E-Next and other structures to both the originators and accounting. The successful effort Origination has had this year with developments has provided tremendous document flow which has allowed Catherine to develop her document review skills from both a financing and commercial perspective. The growth in maturity she has experienced driven by her deal flow has made her one of the core \"go to\" junior people in my group when a deal calls for financial analysis. She has been performing at the manager level for six months and is seen as a leader among the junior staff in the group.\n",
