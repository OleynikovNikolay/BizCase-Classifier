# BizCase-Classifier :robot: :email:
The CLI AI Classification Tool is a utility designed to streamline and enhance the process of categorizing email correspondence into distinct business cases. Leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence, this tool provides an automated solution for managing email communication within professional contexts.


## Background
This AI model is based on the Enron email dataset, which comprises around 500,000 messages. Originally made public during the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's investigation, the dataset was carefully prepared by the CALO Project (Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes).

A subset of approximately 1,700 emails from this dataset was labeled and annotated by students at the University of California, Berkeley, further enriching the dataset for research and development purposes.
